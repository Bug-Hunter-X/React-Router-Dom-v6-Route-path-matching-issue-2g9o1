This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router Dom v6 when dealing with routes that may or may not have trailing slashes. The bug.js file showcases the problem where navigating to '/about' works, but navigating to '/about/' results in a 404 error despite having a catch-all route.  The bugSolution.js file provides a solution using the `useSearchParams` hook to handle this scenario more gracefully.
